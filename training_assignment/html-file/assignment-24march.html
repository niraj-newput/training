                </div>
                    <p>The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single
                     space ( ) character — combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector 
                     are selected if they have an ancestor element matching the first selector. Selectors that 
                     utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.
                 </p>
                <p> The descendant combinator is technically one or more CSS white space characters — 
                     the space character and/or one of four control characters: carriage return, form 
                     feed, new line, and tab characters — between two selectors in the absence of 
                     another combinator. Additionally, the white space characters of which the combinator 
                     is comprised may contain any number of CSS comments.
                 </p>
                <p>The abstract nature of this combinator makes it different from the other standardized 
                     combinators as these combinators are all represented by a distinct, finite character 
                     sequence. This inconsistency was addressed with the addition of a redundant descendant 
                     combinator represented by two greater‐than characters in sequence (>>), giving it a form 
                     that is particularly similar to the child combinator, which shares a similar function.
